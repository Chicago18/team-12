Our goal was to create a portal for different users within the Chinese Mutual Aid Association. We implemented different interfaces for the students, parents, as well as admin/staff of the organization. We were able to create an interactive way for students to perform supplemental assignments, in addition to a streamlined registration process for parents/administrators. We utilized tools such as Flask for Python, SQLite, and Bootstrap.
